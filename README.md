# Advanced SQL Project - SQL Expertise Showcase

## Overview

This repository showcases my expertise in SQL through an advanced SQL project. In this project, I've conducted an in-depth analysis of a database with multiple tables, written complex SQL queries, calculated key performance indicators (KPIs), and performed general data analysis using advanced SQL functions. This README serves as a guide to understand the project and highlights key aspects of my SQL skills.

1. [Analysis of Each Table](#section-1-analysis-of-each-table)
2. [Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)](#section-2-key-performance-indicators-kpis)
3. [General Data Analysis Using Advanced SQL Functions](#section-3-general-data-analysis-using-advanced-sql-functions)

## Section 1: Analysis of Each Table

In this section, we analyze each table in the database and use advanced SQL queries to extract key insights. We explore the Employees table, Departments table, Regions table, Customers table, and Sales table to gain a deep understanding of the data.

## Section 2: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

This section focuses on calculating relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) using advanced SQL functions such as window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), and complex joins. We calculate KPIs like year-over-year sales growth, employee sales performance ranking, customer lifetime value (CLV), sales variance by region and category, and identify the most profitable customers.

## Section 3: General Data Analysis Using Advanced SQL Functions

In this section, we perform general data analysis using various advanced SQL functions and techniques. We cover topics such as ranking, running totals, cumulative sums, rolling averages, and statistical analysis to explore the data further. These queries go beyond basic SQL and provide deeper insights into the dataset.
